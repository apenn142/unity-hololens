1/2,cup,pizza sauce
20,slices pepperoni
12,ounces,mozzarella cheese grated
1/2,teaspoon,ground black pepper
1,teaspoon,fresh oregano (optional)
Flour for rolling and shaping dough
#Steps
Preheat oven to 500F.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. 
If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature.
Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.
Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges.
Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce.
Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown in 500F oven.
