#Steps
Cover 2 large cooking sheets with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 400F.
In a large bowl, combine breadcrumbs, milk, cream, egg, salt, pepper, allspice, nutmeg and parsley. 
Set the mixture aside to allow the milk to soak into the breadcrumbs, at least 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. 
Add the minced onion and sauté until translucent. 
Add the minced garlic and sauté 30 seconds. 
Transfer the onion/garlic mixture to the breadcrumb mixture.
Once the breadcrumb mixture is ready, add the ground chuck and chicken. 
Mix well using a wooden spoon. 
Roll meat into 1½-inch balls (or use a 1½ inch scoop) and place on the prepared sheet pan 1 inch apart. 
Cook 20 minutes or until no longer pink in the center.
