#Steps
Make burger seasoning by combining all spices in a bowl. Set aside.
Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently from into 1/2 inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink). 
Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.
Preheat grill to medium high heat. Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. 
Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. 
Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160F.
Place cheese on burgers during the last minute of cooking. 
Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings.
